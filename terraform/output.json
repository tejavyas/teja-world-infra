These energetic electron flux levels remained elevated at or near threshold levels through the end of the reporting period (see notifications 20250120-AL-001, 20250120-AL-002, and 20250122-AL-002). This elevation of energetic electron flux levels was associated with the arrival of the coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2025-01-16 with additional influences from the subsequent coronal hole high speed stream detected by DSCOVR and ACE at L1 on 2025-01-19. These coronal hole high speed streams reached maximum sustained speeds between approximately 600-650 km/s.\\n\\nThe energetic proton flux of >10 MeV protons detected at GOES and the 13-100 MeV protons at STEREO A were all at background levels for the entire reporting period. \\n\\nSpace Weather Impact:\\nSpace weather impacts on NASA spacecraft are expected to have been low to moderate this reporting period due to the elevated energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt described above.\\n\\n##Events:\\nFlares (M-class and above)\\nDate         Start     Stop      Peak      Class   Location         \\n2025-01-17  02:01:00  02:17:00  02:11:00   M1.3   N07W23 ( 13964 ) \\n2025-01-17  03:08:00  03:34:00  03:20:00   M1.1   S10E43 ( 13961 ) \\n2025-01-17  09:10:00  09:23:00  09:19:00   M2.0   N07W28 ( 13964 ) \\n2025-01-17  11:19:00  11:49:00  11:37:00   M1.5   N07W29 ( 13964 ) \\n2025-01-17  13:24:00  13:39:00  13:35:00   M7.4   N07W30 ( 13964 ) \\n2025-01-17  18:42:00  19:04:00  18:50:00   M2.1   N07W32 ( 13964 ) \\n2025-01-17  19:44:00  19:55:00  19:49:00   M1.8   N05W35 ( 13964 ) \\n2025-01-17  19:59:00  20:02:00  20:01:00   M1.1   N06W29 ( 13964 ) \\n2025-01-17  22:00:00  22:14:00  22:05:00   M1.0   N05W35 ( 13964 ) \\n2025-01-18  00:44:00  01:03:00  00:58:00   M1.7   N06W34 ( 13964 ) \\n2025-01-18  03:00:00  03:15:00  03:07:00   M1.1   N08W36 ( 13964 ) \\n2025-01-19  03:28:00  03:36:00  03:32:00   M2.4   N06W49 ( 13964 ) \\n2025-01-21  10:08:00  11:00:00  10:39:00   M3.3   S18E23 ( 13967 ) \\n\\n\\nCMEs (>500 km/s):\\nEarth directed:\\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \\n2025-01-17T16:24Z     ~741            C                 7/20                10                          SOHO                              \\n2025-01-18T02:00Z     ~530            C                14/26                24                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \\n2025-01-21T10:53Z     ~646            C               -23/-31               37                          STEREO A                          \\n\\nNon-Earth directed (POS = Plane Of Sky):\\nStarting time        Speed (km/s)   Type   Direction (LON/LAT in HEEQ)   Half-Angle width (degrees)  Detecting spacecraft (real-time)  \\n2025-01-15T21:12Z     ~596            C              -116/-54               15                          SOHO                              \\n2025-01-16T22:36Z     ~732            C                75/-64               27                          SOHO                              \\n2025-01-17T15:12Z     ~700            C              -169/-28               15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \\n2025-01-18T01:36Z     ~915            C                27/32                20                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \\n2025-01-18T15:12Z     ~623            C                24/33                10                          SOHO                              \\n2025-01-18T23:24Z     ~802            C         NONE(POS)/-39               23                          SOHO                              \\n2025-01-19T00:36Z     ~767            C                58/-40               26                          SOHO                              \\n2025-01-19T01:37Z     ~555            C         NONE(POS)/-43               18                          SOHO                              \\n2025-01-19T03:24Z     ~501            C               112/-42               21                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \\n2025-01-20T09:36Z     ~692            C                99/-27               10                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \\n2025-01-21T03:48Z     ~752            C              -170/71                31                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \\n2025-01-21T05:00Z     ~548            C               146/-73               12                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \\n2025-01-21T08:48Z     ~1129           O               127/-27               15                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \\n2025-01-21T09:12Z     ~650            C              -166/-13               45                          SOHO, STEREO A                    \\n\\n\\n## Space Weather Outlook:\\n## Outlook Coverage Begin Date: 2025-01-22T00:00Z \\n## Outlook Coverage End Date:  2025-01-28T23:59Z\\n\\nSolar activity is expected to vary between minor and moderate levels during the outlook period. There are currently eight numbered Active Regions on the Earth-facing disk. Active Region 13964 (~N06W100) was responsible for the majority of flaring activity during the reporting period before rotating off the Earth-facing disk on 2025-01-21. This region may be the source of far-sided activity during the outlook period. Active Regions 13961 (S10W33) and 13967 (S17E00) were responsible for two of the M-class flares during the reporting period and may continue to exhibit similar flaring activity as they continue to traverse the Earth-facing disk.\\n\\nGeomagnetic activity is expected to vary between below minor to moderate levels during the outlook period. There may be an enhancement in geomagnetic activity early in the outlook period beginning on or around 2025-01-24 and 2025-01-25 due to the anticipated arrivals of the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2025-01-21T10:53Z and the C-type CME first visible in SOHO LASCO C2 at 2025-01-22T11:36Z (see notifications 20250121-AL-001 and 20250122-AL-004). Additionally, the > 2.0 MeV energetic electron flux in the Earth's outer radiation belt was elevated above the threshold of 1000 pfu on 2025-01-22 and may continue to be elevated throughout the beginning of the outlook period (see notification 20250122-AL-002).\\n\\n## Notes: \\nSCORE CME typification system:\\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\\n\\n\\n\"}}"}
